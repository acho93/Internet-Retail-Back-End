# Internet-Retail-Back-End

## Description
For this challenge, I was tasked with creating the back end code for an e-commerce business. Using Sequelize, I created databases for categories, products, tags, and product tags that can be accessed from the command line. 

Here is a video of how it functions: https://youtu.be/pWRR0RKBdmE

## Installation
You will need to run 'npm install' to install all dependencies, which include Express, Sequelize, MySQL2, and dotenv.

## Usage
To initialize the database, you must first start Sequelize by entering the password. When you run "npm start", the application will start and allow the user to view and update the database from the command line.
