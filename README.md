# Internet-Retail-Back-End

## Description
WRITE THIS PART!!!!!

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating the back end code for a 


an employee database for a business that includes information about the departments, roles, and employees. Using MySQL, I created a database with different tables for "department", "role", and "employee" that can be accessed from the command line. Through Inquirer, the user is prompted through questions that allow the user to view, add, and update the database.

Here is a video of how it functions: 

## Installation
You will need to run 'npm install' to install all dependencies, which include Express, Sequelize, MySQL2, and DotEnv.

## Usage

WRITE THIS PART!!!!!

When you run "node server.js", the application uses Inquirer to prompt the user to answer questions that allow for viewing, adding, and updating of the database from the command line.
